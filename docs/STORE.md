# Sunny Bear — brighten dark websites with one click

Reading outside or under bright lights? Sunny Bear flips dark pages to a clean, light look so your eyes don’t squint. Click to turn on for a site, click again to turn it off. Easy.

### What it does

* **Auto theme detection**: No need to add every dark site manually—Sunny Bear now detects whether a page is dark and brightens it automatically when your OS is in light mode
* **One-click brighten**: Instantly convert dark-theme pages to light when you want
* **Remembers your choice**: Set once per site; Sunny Bear applies it next time
* **Smart with dynamic pages**: Keeps new content bright as the page updates (works on SPAs)
* **Gentle and reversible**: Toggle anytime, no permanent changes
* **Safer browsing**: Won’t run on restricted/protected pages (e.g. chrome://, extension gallery)

### How to use

1. Install Sunny Bear
2. Open any website
3. If your OS is in light mode, Sunny Bear automatically brightens dark pages. You can still click the Sunny Bear icon to toggle manually

### Manage your sites

* Open `Options` to see, edit, import, or export your saved sites
* Saved list now complements auto detection—you can still pin favorite sites

### Notes

* Some sites may look slightly different when brightened—just toggle off if needed
* Existing site lists remain compatible

Browse happily, even under the sun. 🌞🐻
